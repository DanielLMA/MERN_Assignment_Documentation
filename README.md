## Wireframes for multiple standard screen sizes, created using industry standard software	


### Initial wireframes

These are the initial wireframes that were designed loosely based on client descriptions. The original design was to be simple and sleek, with a dark palette and minimal style.

![location draft](docs/wireframes/locationdraft.PNG)

After a meeting with the client and receiving feedback on these designs, the wireframes were then revised and redesigned based on client requests. He specified that he would like to have a lighter theme and a cleaner look.
